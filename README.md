# Non-relativistic time-dependent Schrödinger equation

The non-relativistic time-dependent Schrödinger equation is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics that describes the time evolution of a quantum state. It is given by:

iħ ∂Ψ/∂t = HΨ

where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, Ψ is the wavefunction of a quantum system, and H is the Hamiltonian operator, which describes the total energy of the system. The equation states that the rate of change of the wavefunction with respect to time is proportional to the Hamiltonian acting on the wavefunction.

The wavefunction Ψ contains all the information about the quantum state of the system, including its position, momentum, and other physical properties. The absolute square of the wavefunction |Ψ|^2 gives the probability density of finding the system in a particular state.

The time-dependent Schrödinger equation is a partial differential equation, which means that it describes how the wavefunction varies with both time and position. In practice, the equation is often solved numerically using computational methods such as finite differences or spectral methods.

The non-relativistic version of the Schrödinger equation applies to systems in which the velocities of the particles are much smaller than the speed of light, so that relativistic effects can be neglected. It is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics and is used to study a wide range of physical systems, from atoms and molecules to condensed matter and quantum field theory.
